Here is your **complete Replit Assistant prompt** tailored for your current TrustGraphed backend structure, designed to **build all 6 modules, wire them into the `/evaluate` endpoint, and return a TrustScore with dummy logic**.

### ✅ Copy–Paste This into Replit AI:

````python
You're working in a full-stack Flask project called TrustGraphed. The backend is located in `/backend/`, with `app.py` as the entrypoint and a working `/health` route. CORS is enabled, and the backend is structured with `utils/` and `routes/`.

📌 TASK:
Build the full modular logic pipeline for assertion trust evaluation using 6 core modules. Implement the following with dummy logic (for now):

🧠 MODULES (in /backend/utils/):
1. `sdg.py` — Source Data Grappler: extract 3 fake assertions from input text.
2. `aie.py` — Assertion Integrity Engine: return dummy results like “no contradiction found”.
3. `cce.py` — Confidence Computation Engine: assign a fake confidence score between 0.7 and 0.95 to each assertion.
4. `zfp.py` — Zero-Fabrication Protocol: return “No hallucination detected”.
5. `score_engine.py` — TrustScore Engine: average confidence score and return final score out of 100.
6. `certificate.py` — Certificate Generator: return a dummy certificate JSON with UUID, timestamp, TrustScore.

🛠️ ENDPOINT:
- Create a new route file `/backend/routes/evaluate.py`.
- Register it as a blueprint in `app.py`.
- Expose POST `/evaluate` which takes JSON `{ "content": "..." }`, passes it through all modules, and returns:

```json
{
  "summary": "Trust evaluation complete",
  "trust_score": 87.5,
  "details": {
    "assertions": [...],
    "aie": "No contradiction found",
    "cce_scores": [...],
    "zfp_result": "No hallucination detected"
  },
  "certificate": { "uuid": "abc-123", "issued_at": "...", ... }
}
````

🎯 GOAL:
Make sure `/evaluate` returns the above structure with dummy logic, wired through all 6 utils. The app must still run via `python3 backend/app.py`, with no errors.

```

### 🔁 Once That’s Done:

You’ll be ready to:

- Call `/evaluate` from Postman or frontend
- Replace dummy logic with real ML/NLP models or heuristics
- Begin rendering results in your frontend

Let me know when it’s done, and I’ll generate the next prompt for rendering this in your frontend UI. You're now executing the protocol as described in your patent.
