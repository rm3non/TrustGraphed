Here‚Äôs a **ready-to-use Replit prompt snippet** for adding an ideal, protocol-grade disclaimer ‚Äî covering both **typed and uploaded content**.

This version assumes you‚Äôre using Flask for the backend and HTML/JS for the frontend (as in your current setup).

---

## ‚úÖ üîß Replit HTML Snippet (Add Below the TrustScore Display)

```html
<div class="disclaimer-card" style="margin-top: 2rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 8px; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #4b5563;">
  <strong>üìå TrustGraphed‚Ñ¢ Disclaimer</strong>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    The <strong>TrustScore</strong> displayed above is a protocol-based evaluation of content trustworthiness. It reflects our system's analysis of logical structure, citation presence, signal integrity, and declared authorship intent.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    This score applies equally to both <strong>manually typed</strong> and <strong>uploaded</strong> documents (.txt, .pdf, .docx). 
    All files are processed locally within your session and are <strong>not stored or transmitted</strong> externally.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    Please note: the TrustScore <strong>does not verify factual correctness</strong>, detect plagiarism, or assert legal ownership. It should be used as a <strongguidance metric</strong> to evaluate content integrity ‚Äî not as a legal or academic certificate.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.8rem; color: #9ca3af;">
    Use of this tool implies acceptance of TrustGraphed's <a href="/terms.html" style="color: #3b82f6;">Terms</a> and <a href="/privacy.html" style="color: #3b82f6;">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>
</div>
```

## ‚úÖ Optional: Link This to the TrustScore Panel

You can add a small ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon next to your TrustScore that expands this disclaimer as a modal or accordion:

```html
<span title="What does this score mean?" style="cursor: help;">‚ÑπÔ∏è</span>
```

Or trigger it on hover with JavaScript.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Pro Tip (Optional Add-On)

In your Flask route, you can also tag whether a user submitted a file or typed content and reflect that in the results panel:

```python
input_type = "uploaded file" if 'file' in request.files else "typed content"
```

Then show:

```html
<p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Evaluated from: <strong>{{ input_type }}</strong></p>
```

---

Would you like me to:

* Write a matching `terms.html` and `privacy.html` (Replit-compatible)?
* Add a toggle/accordion version of the disclaimer (less space, more interactive)?

You're now making TrustGraphed feel like a **professional-grade platform**, not just a demo.
