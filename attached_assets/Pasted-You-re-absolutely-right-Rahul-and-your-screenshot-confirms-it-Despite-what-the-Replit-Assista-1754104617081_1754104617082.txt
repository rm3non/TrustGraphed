You're absolutely right, Rahul ‚Äî and your screenshot confirms it.

Despite what the Replit Assistant claimed earlier, **your current deployed UI does *not*** support file uploads ‚Äî only direct text input. So the application is **not fully feature-complete** as per your original spec (which includes `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` content ingestion).

---

### ‚úÖ You‚Äôve implemented:

* Functional backend with all 6 modules
* Frontend textarea for manual input
* Health check, CORS, `/evaluate` endpoint, and trust score display

---

### ‚ùå Still missing (as of now):

#### üîª 1. **File Upload Feature**

* No file upload `<input type="file">` in `index.html`
* No logic in `app.js` to read and process selected files
* No route or JS to convert uploaded files into text before passing to `/evaluate`

## ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Fix That Now: File Upload Integration Prompt

Here's the **exact prompt** to paste into Replit's AI assistant to *implement full file upload support*:

> üîß **Prompt to Replit AI Assistant**:

```markdown
My TrustGraphed frontend currently only accepts text in a textarea for evaluation. I want you to implement full file upload support for `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files. Here‚Äôs what I need:
 
1. Modify `templates/index.html` to add a file input option alongside the existing textarea. Ensure the user can choose *either* input method (not both at once).
2. Update `static/app.js` to:
    - Detect file uploads
    - Use FileReader for `.txt`
    - Use `pdfjsLib` for `.pdf` parsing
    - Use `mammoth.js` or similar for `.docx` parsing
    - Extract plain text from file
    - Replace textarea content dynamically with parsed text before calling `/evaluate`
3. Do **not** change the existing `/evaluate` backend route ‚Äî just submit the extracted text.
4. Keep styling consistent with the current UI (`styles.css`).
5. Show a preview of the uploaded content (just first 300 characters) in the frontend so users know what was parsed.

Let me know before modifying multiple files at once, and do not break any existing UI functionality.
```

## ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements After That

Once Replit has added file upload:

* ‚úÖ Add a "Clear" button to reset both text and file
* ‚úÖ Disable the "Analyze" button unless valid input (‚â•10 chars) exists
* ‚úÖ Save last evaluation in `localStorage` for quick refresh test

---

Let me know when they've done this. I can then help you write test cases for `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx` and validate if they're parsed and scored correctly through your SDG and other modules.

You're right to be sharp about this ‚Äî it‚Äôs this detail-level focus that makes the protocol *real*.
