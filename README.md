## 🚀 Overview

TrustGraphed™ is a revolutionary 6-module content verification engine that evaluates the **authenticity**, **integrity**, and **trustworthiness** of digital content. It processes text, PDFs, and DOCX files through a sophisticated pipeline to generate **Trust Scores** and **cryptographically verifiable certificates**.

**Live Demo**: [https://trustgraphed.replit.app](https://trustgraphed.replit.app)

- 🧠 **6-Stage Pipeline**: Deterministic trust analysis through specialized modules
- 🔍 **Deep Analysis**: Source verification, assertion integrity, confidence computation, and fabrication detection
- 📊 **Trust Scoring**: Comprehensive 0-1.0 scoring with detailed breakdowns
- 🧾 **Verification Certificates**: Cryptographically signed authenticity certificates
- ⚡ **Real-time Processing**: Instant evaluation with detailed explanations
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Ready**: Built for institutional-grade content verification

## 🏗️ Architecture

### TrustGraphed Protocol Pipeline

```
Content Input → [SDG] → [AIE] → [CCE] → [ZFP] → [Score Engine] → [Certificate] → Results
```

1. **SDG** - Source Data Grappler: Extracts assertions and citations
2. **AIE** - Assertion Integrity Engine: Detects contradictions and logical issues  
3. **CCE** - Confidence Computation Engine: Analyzes language confidence patterns
4. **ZFP** - Zero-Fabrication Protocol: Identifies AI-generated content indicators
5. **Score Engine** - Aggregates all modules into weighted trust score
6. **Certificate Generator** - Creates verifiable authenticity certificates

## 🎯 Trust Score Breakdown

### Scoring Methodology

TrustGraphed™ uses a **weighted aggregation** approach:

- **Source Data Grappler (15%)**: Content structure and extractability
- **Assertion Integrity Engine (25%)**: Logical consistency and contradictions
- **Confidence Computation Engine (25%)**: Language certainty and citation support
- **Zero-Fabrication Protocol (35%)**: AI-generation and fabrication detection

### Trust Levels

| Score Range | Level | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 0.90 - 1.00 | **VERY HIGH** | Exceptional trustworthiness |
| 0.75 - 0.89 | **HIGH** | Strong reliability indicators |
| 0.60 - 0.74 | **MODERATE** | Mixed signals, verification recommended |
| 0.40 - 0.59 | **LOW** | Concerning indicators present |
| 0.00 - 0.39 | **VERY LOW** | Significant trustworthiness issues |
