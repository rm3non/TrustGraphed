## 🚀 Overview

TrustGraphed™ is a 6-module content verification engine that evaluates the **authenticity**, **integrity**, and **trustworthiness** of any textual content (including uploaded documents). It outputs a **Trust Score** and a **cryptographically verifiable certificate**.

It is designed as a protocol-level infrastructure for the internet — similar to how HTTPS secures transmission, TrustGraphed™ secures *content authenticity*.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 📥 Upload or paste digital content (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`)
- 🧠 6-stage deterministic trust analysis pipeline
- 🔎 Modular breakdown: SDG, AIE, CCE, ZFP, Score Engine, Certificate Generator
- 📊 Trust Score computation & provenance validation
- 🧾 Shareable verification certificate generation
- ⚡ Realtime UI evaluation for web content
- 🧩 Designed to be protocol-first, not product-first

## 🧱 Architecture

**TrustGraphed Protocol Pipeline**

1. `sdg.py` – Source Data Grappler  
2. `aie.py` – Assertion Integrity Engine  
3. `cce.py` – Confidence Computation Engine  
4. `zfp.py` – Zero-Fabrication Protocol  
5. `score_engine.py` – TrustScore Engine  
6. `certificate.py` – Certificate Generator  

All modules are integrated and exposed via a REST API in `routes/evaluate.py`.

## 🎯 Trust Score Breakdown

TrustGraphed™ provides detailed analysis across multiple dimensions:

- **Source Verification**: Data provenance and origin analysis
- **Assertion Integrity**: Fact checking and logical consistency
- **Confidence Computation**: Statistical reliability assessment
- **Zero-Fabrication**: AI-generated content detection
- **Overall Trust Score**: Composite score (0-100%)
- **Verification Certificate**: Cryptographic proof of analysis

## 🌍 Vision

TrustGraphed™ aims to become the **default infrastructure layer** for trust on the internet. Just like SSL certs changed web security, we envision a future where every serious piece of content comes with verifiable authenticity metadata.
